About WNDOPT3R

WNDOPT3R is a collection of carefully crafted PowerShell scripts that work together to optimize your Windows system. It covers various aspects such as system cleanup, performance tweaks, security enhancements, and more. By following the steps outlined below, you'll be able to take advantage of this powerful tool and enjoy a more efficient and secure Windows environment.

Steps to Use WNDOPT3R

Step 1: Download or Clone the Repository

To begin, you need to obtain a copy of the WNDOPT3R script. You can either download the latest release as a ZIP file from the GitHub Releases page or clone the repository using Git. Make sure to choose a location where you can easily find the files later.

Step 2: Extract the Files

Once you have downloaded or cloned the repository, extract its contents to a folder on your computer. It is essential to remember the location of this folder, as you will need to access it later during the setup process.

Step 3: Open PowerShell with Admin Privileges

To execute the WNDOPT3R scripts, you'll need to use PowerShell with administrative privileges. Press Win + X and select "Windows PowerShell (Admin)" from the menu. This will open a PowerShell window with elevated permissions.

Step 4: Set Execution Policy to Unrestricted

WNDOPT3R uses PowerShell scripts, which may require adjusting the execution policy on your system. Type the following command in the PowerShell window and press Enter:

Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted

You will be prompted to confirm the change. Type Y and press Enter to proceed. This will allow the scripts to run without any restrictions.

Step 5: Navigate to the Extracted Folder

Now, navigate to the folder where you extracted the WNDOPT3R files using the cd command. Move to the "PS SCRIPTS" subfolder by typing:

cd path\to\your\wndopt3r\folder\PS\SCRIPTS

Replace path\to\your\wndopt3r\folder with the actual path to the folder where you extracted the files.

Step 6: List the Scripts

Before executing the scripts, it's a good idea to list the available files in the folder. Type:

ls

This will display a list of files in the current directory, including the WNDOPT3R scripts.

Step 7: Execute the Scripts

Now, it's time to run each script one by one. To execute a script, use the following syntax:

./<script_name>

Replace <script_name> with the actual name of the script file (e.g., optimize_disk.ps1). Make sure to run each script sequentially without closing the PowerShell window.

Step 8: Reboot Your PC

After executing all the scripts, it is crucial to reboot your system to apply the changes and ensure optimal performance. Save any open files and type:

shutdown /r /t 0

This command will initiate a restart of your computer immediately.

Important Note:

Please ensure you have a backup of your important data before executing the WNDOPT3R scripts, as some operations may result in data loss or system instability. Always exercise caution and follow the instructions provided in this README to avoid any potential issues.
